# Open Core License for aegnt-27: The Human Peak Protocol

**Version 1.0 - Effective Date: December 6, 2024**

This Open Core License Agreement ("Agreement") governs the use of the open source components of aegnt-27: The Human Peak Protocol software ("Software").

## Open Source Components

The following components are licensed under the MIT License and are free to use:

### ‚úÖ **Framework & Interfaces** (MIT Licensed)
- Core engine interfaces and builder patterns (`src/lib.rs`)
- Configuration structures and validation (`src/config.rs`) 
- Error handling and result types (`src/error.rs`)
- Basic utility functions (`src/utils.rs`)
- Example code and documentation (`examples/`, `docs/`)

### ‚úÖ **Basic Implementations** (MIT Licensed)
- **Basic Mouse Movement**: Simple linear interpolation and basic curves
- **Basic Typing Simulation**: Fixed timing patterns with simple WPM variation
- **Basic Detection Validation**: Heuristic checks (60-70% accuracy)
- **Basic Audio Processing**: Simple filtering and noise injection
- **Basic Visual Enhancement**: Simple gaze pattern simulation

## Performance Limitations of Open Source Version

| Feature | Open Source | Proprietary |
